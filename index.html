        <h1>Just one voice</h1>
        <sup>-By C Ward</sup>
        <p class="poem">Each day I learn, research, and read.<br>
            About all the animals who are in need.<br>
            The circus, the rodeo, the fur and factory farm.<br>
            The pain, the fear, the unbelievable harm!<br>
            <br>
            The research scientists who causes pain.<br>
            The dog in the yard chained in the rain.<br>
            The kitten drowned, the puppy burned.<br>
            These are just a few of the horrible tragedies<br>
            of which I've learned!<br>
            <br>
            The innocent ones they have no choice.<br>
            The innocent ones they have no voice.<br>
            The horror inflicted upon those so dear.<br>
            And so many people who do not want to hear.<br>
            <br>
            Each of us, we have choice.<br>
            Each of us, we have a voice.<br>
            Use your voice to educate.<br>
            Pass out leaflets, demonstrate.<br>
            Write letters, boycott stores.<br>
            Knock on all your neigbours' doors.<br>
            <br>
            Use your voice as I have mine.<br>
            You can help, it just takes time.<br>
            <br>
