# Just-one-voice
The website design is for displaying the poem using HTML and CSS. Moreover, I have used some effects on images and background by utilizing gradients. Just one voice is a poem written by C Ward for us to protect the animals from harm. I have seen numerous animals being harmed either by accident or deliberately. Those innocent animals' lives matter just like our lives matter.
